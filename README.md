# Nix-based dotfiles

## [![built with nix](https://builtwithnix.org/badge.svg)](https://builtwithnix.org)

I'm trying to replace my current `dotfiles` configuration by basing it in Nix and shamelessly ripping off several other `dotfiles` repos.

## Influences

- `github:sherubthakur/dotfiles`
- `github:tars0x9752/home`
- `Misterio77/nix-config`
- `nix-community/todomvc-nix`
