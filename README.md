I'm trying to replace my current `dotfiles` configuration by basing it in Nix and shamelessly ripping off several other `dotfiles` repos.

> guarantees that it will work out of the box for anyone but myself. It may also

## Usage

- Run `sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#hostname` to apply your system configuration.
  - If you're still on a live installation medium, run `nixos-install --flake .#hostname` instead, and reboot.
- Run `darwin-rebuild switch --flake .#username@hostname` to apply your home configuration.
  - If you don't have nix-darwin installed, try `nix build .#darwinConfigurations.hostname.system` or see [here](https://github.com/LnL7/nix-darwin) for installation.
- Run `home-manager switch --flake .#username@hostname` to apply your home configuration.
  - If you don't have home-manager installed, try `nix shell nixpkgs#home-manager`.
  - When using for the first time, if the above does not work, try activating it directly:

    ```console
    nix build --no-link .#homeConfigurations.username@hostname.activationPackage
    "$(nix path-info .#homeConfigurations.username@hostname.activationPackage)"/activate
    ```

And that's it, really! You're ready to have fun with your configurations using the latest and greatest nix3 flake-enabled command UX.

## Issues

### cannot link '/nix/store/.tmp-link-XX-XXXX' to '/nix/store/.links/XXXXX': File exists

This can happen when some derivation fails to build for any reason and one dependency gets a lock that is not released. Those get generated by `nix-store --optimize`.

Running `nix-store --optimise` can get a lot of `skipping suspicious writable file '/nix/store/XXXXXX'` messages.

**Try `nix-collect-garbage --max-freed 10m`.**

Also, this issue seems to happen randomly, each time with a different derivation failing, and if you try enough times it can eventually go away. If you want to automate this to assure you end up actually switching your system:

**Try running `until <switch_command>; do sleep 1; done`**

### VSCodium won't update

Usually accompanied by the message "An update is ready to install. Visual Studio Code is trying to add a new helper tool".

This is usually caused due to VSCod{e,ium} residing in a different path than `/Applications`. To fix, according to <https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7426#issuecomment-277737150>:

```console
sudo chown $USER ~/Library/Caches/com.vscodium.ShipIt/* #Â or com.microsoft.VSCode.ShipIt/*
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine ~/Applications/Home\ Manager\ Apps/VSCodium.app # Or Visual\ Studio\ Code.app
```
