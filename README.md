# Nix-based dotfiles

## [![built with nix](https://builtwithnix.org/badge.svg)](https://builtwithnix.org)

I'm trying to replace my current `dotfiles` configuration by basing it in Nix and shamelessly ripping off several other `dotfiles` repos.

## Influences

- [`github:sherubthakur/dotfiles`](https://github.com/sherubthakur/dotfiles)
- `github:tars0x9752/home`
- `Misterio77/nix-config`
- `nix-community/todomvc-nix`

## Issues

### cannot link '/nix/store/.tmp-link-XX-XXXX' to '/nix/store/.links/XXXXX': File exists

Those get generated by `nix-store --optimize`.

Running `nix-store --optimise` can get a lot of `skipping suspicious writable file '/nix/store/XXXXXX'` messages.

**Try `nix-collect-garbage --max-freed 10m`.**
