I'm trying to replace my current `dotfiles` configuration by basing it in Nix and shamelessly ripping off several other `dotfiles` repos.

## Issues

### cannot link '/nix/store/.tmp-link-XX-XXXX' to '/nix/store/.links/XXXXX': File exists

This can happen when some derivation fails to build for any reason and one dependency gets a lock that is not released. Those get generated by `nix-store --optimize`.

Running `nix-store --optimise` can get a lot of `skipping suspicious writable file '/nix/store/XXXXXX'` messages.

**Try `nix-collect-garbage --max-freed 10m`.**

### VSCodium won't update

Usually accompanied by the message "An update is ready to install. Visual Studio Code is trying to add a new helper tool".

This is usually caused due to VSCod{e,ium} residing in a different path than `/Applications`. To fix, according to <https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7426#issuecomment-277737150>:

```console
sudo chown $USER ~/Library/Caches/com.vscodium.ShipIt/* #Â or com.microsoft.VSCode.ShipIt/*
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "~/Applications/Home Manager Apps/VSCodium.app"
```
